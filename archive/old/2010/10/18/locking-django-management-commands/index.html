                <h2>Locking Django management commands</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Oct 2010</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I have a number of management commands running via cron and sometimes they take longer to run than the time imbetween jobs.  I don't want two jobs runningin parallel so when I saw that <a href="http://github.com/jtauber/django-notification/">Django Notification</a>&nbsp;used lock files in its emission of notices, I wanted to apply that cleanly to my management commands.</p>
<p>So I created a decorator that would add a locking file based on the current module file name, which would ensure that there is only ever one process running at any time.  Then all I have to do is simply decorate my management commands by applying the decorator to the handle method like so:</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># load the deocrator
from decorators import handle_lock

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = &quot;Regular Management command.&quot;

    # decorate the handle
    @handle_lock
    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        # Do your stuff here</pre></div>
</div>

<p><code> </code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And volia the management command will only ever run in single file.  Go ahead and try it out:</p>
