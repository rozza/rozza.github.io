<p>Well after an long drive back down from the inlaws in Newcastle the family are back home and after watching Downton Abbey, I remembered I hadn't done any exercise today!</p>
<p>Earlier I had bought a cheap heart rate watch from Tescos; the idea being as I start training in ernest for my Triathlon in July, I need to know if I'm over training and stressing the body as apparently you will get ill, pick up extra injuries etc... So to do this I need to work out my resting heart rate and then each morning after waking take my rate and check it. &nbsp;If its too up, you need to rest up and recover - I'm not sure what '<em>too up</em>' is yet but I'll get there!..</p>
<p>So my phone with Runkeeper (elite version now <strong>free</strong>&nbsp;for jan from the andriod store) had run out of batteries after using google navigation on the way home and I failed to start the stop watch on my new watch - so I guessed the time it took to do the lap.</p>
<p>Day two of Janathon done! &nbsp;Oh and the run was good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
