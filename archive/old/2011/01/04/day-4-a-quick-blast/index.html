<p style="color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Firstly, four days in a row - wow!  I'm quite proud but I shan't prattle on about it as it would get quite tiresome - so maybe just once a week!</p>
<p style="color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Anyway, after a long run yesterday, I was a bit stiff and found my knee and hip was sore afterwards. After a day of popping into London with my daughter and walking round the Science Museum (the interactive bits are excellent!) the stiffness in my hip is nearly gone.  I think it wise for me to include rest days during janathon otherwise I won't last the distance!</p>
<p style="color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;">So I planned a run round the estate and I felt great!  Surprisingly, I managed my best pace for over 10 years!  (Not that I overly did much running in the last 10 :p ).  Hip felt ok and I made sure I stretched it out well afterwards.  Depending on how it is tomorrow, I may do a longer run tomorrow...</p>
<p style="color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;"><strong>Stats:</strong></p>
<p style="color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Distance: 1.08 mi<br />Duration: 8:45<br />Avg. Pace: 8:04 min/mi</p>
