<p>Mondays come round all to quickly but luckily they seem to go quickly too!</p>
<p>I'm still really enjoying the new&nbsp;regime&nbsp;of cycling to work and have been quite lucky with the weather. &nbsp;Last night it was wet and I noticed the Boris bike wasn't too grippy on the cobbles, so took extra care but I still managed an Avg pace of under 7 minutes miles! &nbsp;So since starting a couple of weeks ago my pace has improved by a minute a mile! &nbsp;Thats including being caught up by all the traffic lights last night as Murphys Law was in action and I wanted to catch an earlier train, I missed it by a minute :(</p>
<p>I was planning on going for a swim once I got home from work, but feeling a little run down I decided to skip it and rest up.</p>
