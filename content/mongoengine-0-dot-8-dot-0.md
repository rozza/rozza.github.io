I'm really pleased to annouce the release of
[MongoEngine 0.8.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mongoengine/0.8.0).
Its been a *long process* due to work and life commitments but the latest version
of MongoEngine is here.

Whats changed?
--------------

There have been loads of fixes, improvements and changes in 0.8.
The headliners are:

  * Minimum requirements are python 2.6+ and pymongo 2.5+
  * Inheritance now off by default
  * Inherited documents store `_cls` not `_types` (preventing auto creation of
  	multikey indexes)
  * Querysets are immutable and now return clones
  * New Geo Fields supporting mongodb 2.4 new "2dSphere" indexes
  * New context managers for switching collections or databases on the fly as
  	well as turning off dereferencing
  * Django support improved (now supports Django 1.5.1, groups and permissions)
  * Performance improvements, back to the same performance as 0.4

And much, much more!
