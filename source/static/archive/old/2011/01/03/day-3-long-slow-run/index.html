<p><span style="color: #555555; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Bloody dark this morning, which made the initial cross country parts hard work. &nbsp;It didn't help, that I merrily ran out in my road trainers instead of my trail ones, so I was slipping round some of the early fields like bambi.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #555555; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20px;">Adam set a hard pace; I was suffering from too many mince pies over christmas! &nbsp;I found the first 5 miles hardwork and took a few walk breaks. &nbsp;I also forgot what a b*stard the hill is at the start - I sounded like darth vader as I ran/stumbled up it!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #555555; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 20px;">Excellent on-in should have run with a negative split which is a first!</span></p>
