<p style="color: #444444; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;">It was all going well, then runkeeper annouced I was doing 13min miles - which when I thought I was doing a fine pace seemed very odd.  Distracted I wondered across a road only to notice a car was also planning on using it.  So I stopped and waved an apology!  So I took the morale there to be; stop being obsessed by stats - it'll only ruin a perfectly good run!</p>
<p style="color: #444444; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;">I'm planning on joining a gym tomorrow, so I'll be able to start so cross training in and reduce the wear on my legs.</p>
