<p style="color: #444444; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;">Today my daughter started school she was extra excited, I was excited and anxious and the result was a bad nights sleep for all! &nbsp;She loved it and I had a school dinner with her to help introduce the canteen - school dinners have improved, curry and crumble! &nbsp;Lovely!</p>
<p style="color: #444444; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;">I also found a gym its quite small but has the kit I need is local, relatively cheap and also gives free access to the local swimming pool - so win! &nbsp;The downside, is I have to wait until the 17th to join so I can get Nov and Dec free (if I'm still a member). &nbsp;I'm booked in then and can't wait to be able to do some strength training and focus on my triathlon training for july.</p>
<p style="color: #444444; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;">On to the run; I enjoyed it, but I've noticed my right knee has been sore since the weekends long run, so I made sure I did a warm up and included stretches. So I jogged round and dropped off the wifes Avon order, stretched and to liven up the run I tried a bit of fartlek between lamposts - really broke up the run and made it more enjoyable!</p>
<p style="color: #444444; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;">Mind you streching can cause injury, when back home my foot got attacked by the cat!</p>
