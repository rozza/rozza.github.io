<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">After a week of not running to rest my knee, the day of the grim had arrived and I loved it.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">The course was good, lots of puddles and lots you can avoid initially, but wheres the fun in that? &nbsp;The sooner your feet get wet the quicker you get used to it. &nbsp;At around 2 miles you couldn't really avoid the puddles - up to about thigh height at this point. &nbsp;Cold toes dont make for fun running, but you soon get them warmed up and then the later puddles feel refreshing! &nbsp;Some were strangley warm, probably best not to think about that...</p>
<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">The course was good and around 5 miles there was a real stinker of an obstacle; a cargo net and some excellent mud. &nbsp;Then into some water, I was in a rut and the water was up to my waist; being 6' 2" I can confirm it was deep!! &nbsp;Everyone slowed down to tackle that one, so once out I speeded up, but with tired legs and mud on my glasses I tripped and went flying. &nbsp;Everyone running by checked I was ok and one chap even gave me a score: 8.5 - Not Bad!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-left: 0px; color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; padding: 0px;">A great event, tough on the legs but a hell of a lot of fun! &nbsp;I'll be back next year for sure.</p>
