<div class="post">
<p>Up with the larks this morning to go for my weekly run with Adam. Still very dark in the mornings, so the first off road section was slightly hazardous. &nbsp;It seems to have got so much muddier in the last two weeks the fields have changed into a quagmire of mud and puddles. So not too dissimilar from last weekend!</p>
<p>The run felt great, in fact managed negative splits. &nbsp;By the end my legs were so tired I decided a cold bath would help them. &nbsp; Now for my momentous moment of the day: I managed a cold bath without screaming like a girl! &nbsp;As my legs were so muddy, I didn't stretch out after the run big mistake as after the cold bath my legs felt too cold to stretch out...</p>
