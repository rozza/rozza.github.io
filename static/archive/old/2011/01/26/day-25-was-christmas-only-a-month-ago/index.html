<p>Nothing much to report today, cycled to and from work to the station. &nbsp;The <strong>only</strong>&nbsp;thing of note is all the bikes in on dock were bust, so I had to tappy lappy over to the next nearest dock. &nbsp; Apparently, there is a convention is to turn the seat facing backwards if its bust, so from now on I will do!</p>
<p>Oh and the other thing of note, is really a note to self; when going from a new dock think about the route before you end up being stuck on a one way stretch sandwiched imbetween two buses...</p>
