<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.galeforce-events.com/sprintseries.htm" title="Galeforce sprint series" target="_blank">Galeforce events</a> for putting on a great event, it was my first real sprint triathlon - I did one back in 2003 but with no training I don't really count it.</p>
<p>The venue was easy to get to and had ample parking, I was slightly nervous using my new bike rack on the car, but it was great (thanks Halfords!). &nbsp;I got there with plenty of time to spare, got my transition area sorted. &nbsp;I noticed lots of people using plastic boxes to carry / store their transition kit in - much easier and tidier than a bag, so I'll do the same next time. &nbsp;The swimming pool changing rooms were open, but don't really have many facilities - there was always a queue for the gents (pre race jitters I suppose). &nbsp;I put myself down for a 5:30 swim based on my training the week before, so I had a long wait before starting - over an hour. &nbsp;A feel laps of the diving pool, did little to calm the nerves.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Swim - 400m (07:00)</span></p>
<p>I was expecting better from myself in terms of time, but it didn't click, my breathing was laboured and it felt far more tiring than I expected and I was over taken twice, so not great in the end it took me 7 mins to complete. &nbsp;Not great at all, so next sprint I'll use that time and should get in and started sooner.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Bike - 24k (56:14)</span></p>
<p>The transition went ok, I decided against putting socks on, so just dried myself quickly, hat on and off. &nbsp;The swim shorts felt really tight on my legs to begin with and I was worried that the rear tire was low / going flat. &nbsp;I worried too much, clipped the curb and flew off into the grass / nettles / thistles in the verge - ouch. &nbsp;I was all in one piece - grazed and had a burning sensation of the nettles but I got back on and got on with the ride. &nbsp;The ride itself seemed uphill to the A6 then dips and then a short sharp uphill before a downhill into Paversham. &nbsp;Then a nice downhill and fast on-in.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Run - 5k (25:51)</span></p>
<p>To me it felt a little shorter than 5k, but I did better than I thought I would and after 26mins I'd finished and felt like a triathlete!</p>
<p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Total Time: 1:31:12</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the bike incident hurt more than I realised, my shoulder took the brunt of the fall and ached, but worst of all was the itching from the nettles - took me ages to fall asleep. &nbsp;Note to self, look where your going when riding the bike!!</p>
